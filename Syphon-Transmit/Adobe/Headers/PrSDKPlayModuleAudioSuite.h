/**
**	Audio playback overview:
**
**	A playmod has two choices for playing audio: it can ask the host (Premiere) to play
**	the audio through the audio device selected by the user, or it can handle its own
**	playback of audio. A single playmod could use both states for different play events.
**
**	For host-based audio, the following sequence of calls should happen:
**
**	- Plugin receives a preroll selector.
**	- Plugin calls initHostAudio.
**	- Plugin returns from preroll selector.
**	- Plugin receives a start playback selector.
**	- Plugin calls startAudio.
**	- Plugin plays.
**	- Plugin receives stop playback selector.
**	- Plugin calls stopAudio.
**
**	During playback, the plugin can get the current play position from the host using
**	getCurrentTime, which will be clocked from the audio device.
**
**	For plugin-based audio, the following sequence should happen.
**
**	- Plugin receives a preroll selector.
**	- Plugin calls initPluginAudio, passing a AudioPlaybackSettings struct holding
**		the current audio playback settings.
**	- Plugin returns from preroll selector.
**	- Plugin receives a start playback selector.
**	- Plugin calls startAudio.
**	- Plugin plays. Whenever the plugin needs another buffer of audio, it calls getNextAudioBuffer.
**		Note that these buffers are always sequential.
**	- Plugin receives stop playback selector.
**	- Plugin calls stopAudio.
**
**	Note that the initAudio and startAudio calls can fail by returning an error code.
**	If this happens, then the player must abort preroll or playback start.
**
**	Premiere will return a negative countdown during its own audio preroll, which will
**	last at least as long as the requested minimum preroll time in the StartAudio call.
